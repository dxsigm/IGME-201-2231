# IGME-201-2231, New Media Interactive Design and Algorithmic Problem Solving III, Fall 2023: Syllabus

## Course Catalog Description

*This is the third course in the software development sequence for new media interactive development students. Students further their exploration of problem solving and abstraction through coverage of topics such as GUI development, events, file I/O, networking, threading, and other advanced topics related to the design and development of modern dynamic applications. Programming assignments are an integral part of the course.*

## Course Goals and Objectives
At the end of this course, a student should be able to implement moderately large programming projects either individually and/or in a team. Specifically, a student should:
- Demonstrate the ability to translate UI/UX requirements into working programs with an emphasis on usability and presentation.
- Demonstrate the ability to construct and use linear data structures to design software solutions. Data structures include lists, stacks and queues.
- Demonstrate the ability to design and implement software applications that use event-driven graphical user interfaces using Windows Forms.
- Describe how exceptions work, explain their uses and employ them in their own designs.
- Define inheritance and interface relationships and appropriately use design patterns in their own program designs.
- Read and write files from within a software application.
- Demonstrate the ability to construct multi-threaded programs that may run on multi-core computers.
- Implement software applications that use basic networking protocols.

We will assess all of this work with in-class exercises, homework, projects, and exams, as discussed below.

## Course Materials and Communication
_Beginning C#_ by Karli Watson, et al.

Most course materials and example code will be distributed via GitHub and myCourses, and you will also be learning how to use GitHub to manage your own project files.

myCourses will be used for announcements, links to course content, quizzes and exams, assignment submissions, and grading.

A Slack workspace (https://igme-201-01-2231.slack.com) has been created to provide an avenue of communication between professors, teaching assistants, and students. You should use Slack as your primary way for getting in touch with your professor (unless instructed otherwise) and use email only for ‘official business’ where a more formal record is required.  The Slack server will be either deleted or wiped clean at the end of the semester, so be sure to ‘save’ any great piece of information you see on it elsewhere.  Please request membership in our Slack workspace within the first day of classes.

## Attendance
Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and may be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early unless specifically dismissed).

## Grading
Final course grades are determined using the following scale (pluses and minuses will be applied judiciously):

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%  | A |
| 80+%  | B |
| 70+%  | C |
| 65+%  | D |
| <65%  | F |

### Team Project (25%)
- Presentation-rich Front-end User Application due last day of finals and presented during the scheduled final exam time.

### Exams (40%)
These take-home exams, for which you will have at least 7 days to complete, consist of all manner of questions styles (multiple choice, true/false, matching, etc) as well as "write some code" questions. There will be no make-ups or re-takes allowed without prior permission.
-   Unit Test 1 (10%): due week 5
-   Unit Test 2 (10%): due week 9
-   Unit Test 3 (10%): due week 14
-   Final Exam  (10%): due finals week

### Homework & other assignments (30%)
Homeworks, in-class exercises, checkpoints, and other assignments are essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of one Practice Exercise per class meeting. Keep an eye on the myCourses Assignments section for the due dates.

Assignments never submitted on myCourses, or submitted LATE without a valid excuse will receive a score of ZERO for that assignment. (Procrastination is not a valid excuse). If you feel you have a legitimate excuse, please contact the professor in **advance** of the due date either by email or during office hours.

### Attendance, Participation and Engagement (5%)
Your engagement in the class will be graded based on attendance, office hour communication, and Slack and Help Dropbox activity.  Each class absence is a loss of 1 of 5 points (and thus 1% off of your final grade). Each additional absence beyond 5 is 5% off of final average.

### Self-Grading
I am inviting you to participate in the grading process for the homeworks.  Research shows that self-grading increases student learning, reflection and self-assessment of your progress.  I will post the answers as they are due with the distribution of points for each part of the homework.  You will need to assess your grade against these rubrics.  I **will** check your work and give you feedback, but I will **only** adjust grades **upward**.  I trust the evolution of your self-assessment skills, and I will add points if I think you are being too critical of yourself.

As Prof Gardner wrote:

*Contrary to our formalized education that is about control and hierarchy, real learning about compassion, understanding, and intrinsic motivation can never be nurtured through fear, anxiety, or punishment. It is only through the thoughtful cultivation of curiosity, care, and innate wonder that we can actually learn. Anything else is only indoctrination.*

### Pacing
There are 30 homeworks, 3 unit tests, 1 final exam, a team project pitch, documentation submissions and presentations. The first 2 units of the course are intended to make you proficient in C# procedural and object oriented programming, therefore there are approx 3 homeworks a week to give you plenty of practice.  Unit 3 focuses on Windows Forms Programming and the homeworks primarily are tutorials to give you UI/UX practice with the toolbox of controls you will need to implement your team project.  The homeworks become lighter as the semester progresses to give you more time to work with your team on the final project.  I am expecting you to apply yourself to the course material for at least 2 hours per 1 hour lecture.  While at college your job is to be a student, and that should be a full-time job of at least 40 hours per week across all of your courses.

### Extra Credit
I do want everyone to earn A's!  Therefore there will be at least 5 extra credit assignments which can **each** add up to 5 points to your **final grade**.  But I only grant 5 points if they are done proficiently, with ample comments and well-designed structure.  They are due approximately a week before the end of final exams, but you can submit them any time.

### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, solely for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty.

### Academic Dishonesty
The course policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an "F" as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.) While AI such as ChatGPT can give additional insight to a subject area, it is plagiarism to submit AI-generated answers.  All submissions must demonstrate the methods taught in class, otherwise they will be considered plagiarism.  Please review RIT's policy on academic dishonesty: http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html

## Important RIT Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is Tuesday, Sep 5, 2023.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of "W" is Friday, Nov 10, 2023.
- You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade.

## Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", your professor should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class, via Slack, or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.
